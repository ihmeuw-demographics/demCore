\title{Calculate Mean Age of Childbearing from Fertility Rate (MACB)}
\usage{
macb_from_nfx(dt, id_cols, nfx_col = "nfx", value_col = "macb")
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{[\code{data.table()}]\cr A data.table with columns 'age_start',
'age_end', and a column of fertility rates named after \code{nfx_col}.}

\item{id_cols}{[\code{character()}]\cr Columns that uniquely identify each row
of \code{dt}. Must include 'age_start' and 'age_end'.}

\item{nfx_col}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr Name of fertility rate column in \code{dt}.
Defualts to "nfx".}

\item{value_col}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr Name of output 'MACB' column. Defaults
to "mcab"}
}
\value{
[\code{data.table()}] A data.table with calculated 'MACB' for each
unique grouping in \code{id_cols}, stored in \code{value_col}.
}
\description{
The mean age at childbearing is the mean age of mothers at the birth of their
children if women were subject throughout their lives to the age-specific
fertility rates observed in a given year.
